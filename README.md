How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  One can test their software to make sure it is functional and secure. This can be achieved by writing unit tests and testing all the different funtions in your software to make sure it returns the desired output under all conditions. Thorough testing 
  is crucial because your software could cause security concerns for users and clients or physical harm to others. 
   
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 
  When collecting system requirements or user needs I take notes on what the system needs to do to fulfill these needs, then I try to visualize what that would look like. When trying to visualize what that looks like UML diagrams 
  are the most helpful way to do that. Also, at times when collection or interpreting user needs I draw inspiration from how I have seen these problems solved before. 

How do I approach designing software?
   When designing software I personally like to write or draw the different components of the system or software on paper first, to organize my thoughts and give shape to them. Also this helps separate the different objects and
   their functions. Usually after these steps I feel confident enough to go in and start coding the software. If a part of the software is not working how I designed it on paper I then try to find a solution and a lot of the times the 
   final product has its differences from the original design.
